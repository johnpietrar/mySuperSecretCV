                <p>Ionuț is a passionate software engineer with a valuable quality, you can depend on him! We worked together on a fast-paced project, building a video portal with a tight deadline. Ionuț stepped up; I relied on him for complex tasks, working independently, asking the right questions, getting the job done. He was always willing to help his colleagues. I am lucky to have worked together!</p>
